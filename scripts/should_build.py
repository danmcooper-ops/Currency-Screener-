"""Decide whether a scheduled build should proceed.

    python scripts/should_build.py --tz America/New_York --hour 16

Writes `proceed=true|false` and a `reason=` line in GitHub Actions output
format, so the workflow can gate its steps with an `if:` rather than failing
the job — a deliberate skip is not an error and should not show a red X.

Three independent checks.

**Local hour.** GitHub cron is fixed-UTC, but 16:15 America/New_York is
20:15 UTC under EDT and 21:15 UTC under EST. The workflow therefore registers
both crons and this check discards any run that starts before 16:00 local —
under EST that is the 20:15 UTC cron, which lands at 15:15.

The hour is a floor, not a window. GitHub routinely starts scheduled runs
late, and on this repository the delay grew from ~30 minutes to two or more
hours. An earlier version required the run to land *inside* the 16:00 hour,
so from 2026-08-26 every run was discarded as late and the site silently
stopped updating while every run showed green.

**Already built today.** Once both crons can pass the hour check (always,
under EDT), both would build. `--last-built` takes the Unix timestamp of the
last publish — the workflow reads it from the `pages-live` commit — and the
run is skipped if that falls on today's local date. A missing or unreadable
timestamp does not gate: a duplicate build republishes identical output,
while a wrong skip loses the day.

**Fresh ECB data.** The model's spine is the ECB daily reference rate series,
which is not published on TARGET holidays. Rather than maintain a holiday
calendar — which would need updating annually and would encode the wrong
country's calendar anyway — this asks the question that actually matters: did
today's rates publish? If the newest observation is not today's date, there is
nothing new to score, and the build is skipped.

That also catches outages, not just holidays: an ECB endpoint failure looks
identical to a holiday here, and in both cases rebuilding would republish
yesterday's numbers under today's date.
