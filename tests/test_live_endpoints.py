"""Live upstream smoke tests.

Excluded from the default run (see pytest.ini). Run explicitly with:

    pytest -m live -q

These exist to catch the failure mode unit tests cannot: an upstream changing
its response shape or its content-negotiation rules. The BIS `format=csv`
requirement is the concrete example — without it every request returns 406,
and nothing offline would ever notice.
